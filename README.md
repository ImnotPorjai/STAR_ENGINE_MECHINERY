# STAR_ENGINE_MECHINERY
In this simulation, we will animate a star-engine mechanism which have 5 pistons and track the motion of its pistons as the central pentagon crank rotates around center. This exercise is based on concepts from mechanism design and kinematics, focusing on multi-degree-of-freedom linkages and their motion analysis. We will use MATLAB with SYMBOLIC MATH tool's box to construct the mechanism, scale the visual representation , and real time simulate the dynamic motion of the pistons and links.

Goal of the Exercise:

Construct the star engine mechanism using crank–link vector loop equations.

Solve for the angular positions and piston coordinates as a function of crank angle.

Track the trajectory of piston 1 and optionally pentagon center.

Plot the radial velocity of piston 1 over one full rotation of the crank.

Display the piston stroke and highlight maximum and minimum positions.

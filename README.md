# STAR_ENGINE_MECHINERY
In this simulation, we will animate a star-engine mechanism which have 5 pistons and track the motion of its pistons as the central pentagon crank rotates around center. This exercise is based on concepts from mechanism design and kinematics, focusing on multi-degree-of-freedom linkages and their motion analysis. We will use MATLAB to construct the mechanism, scale the visual representation as 2:1, and real time simulate the dynamic motion of the pistons and links.
